<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Kant more fully elaborates his statement of the transcendental ideality of space. He claims that it is a necessary precondition of our experience of external objects, it is the "form" of external sense, but if we are not speaking about human perceptions, the word "space" has no meaning whatsoever.</p>

<h3>§4. Conclusions from the foregoing conceptions.</h3>

<p class='indent'>(a) Space does not represent any property of objects as things in themselves, nor does it represent them in their relations to each other; in other words, space does not represent to us any determination of objects such as attaches to the objects themselves, and would remain, even though all subjective conditions of the intuition were abstracted. For neither absolute nor relative determinations of objects can be intuited prior to the existence of the things to which they belong, and therefore not à priori.</p>

<p class='indent'>(b) Space is nothing else than the form of all phænomena of the external sense, that is, the subjective condition of the sensibility, under which alone external intuition is possible. Now, because the receptivity or capacity of the subject to be affected by objects necessarily antecedes all intuitions of these objects, it is easily understood how the form of all phænomena can be given in the mind previous to all actual perceptions, therefore à priori, and how it, as a pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, can contain principles of the relations of these objects prior to all experience.</p>

<p class='indent'>It is therefore from the human point of view only that we can speak of space, extended objects, &c. If we depart from the subjective condition, under which alone we can obtain external intuition, or, in other words, by means of which we are affected by objects, the representation of space has no meaning whatsoever. This predicate [of space] is only applicable to things in so far as they appear to us, that is, are objects of sensibility. The constant form of this receptivity, which we call sensibility, is a necessary condition of all relations in which objects can be intuited as existing without us, and when abstraction of these objects is made, is a pure intuition, to which we give the name of space. It is clear that we cannot make the special conditions of sensibility into conditions of the possibility of things, but only of the possibility of their existence as far as they are phænomena. And so we may correctly say that space contains all which can appear to us externally, but not all things considered as things in themselves, be they intuited or not, or by whatsoever subject one will. As to the intuitions of other thinking beings, we cannot judge whether they are or are not bound by the same conditions which limit our own intuition, and which for us are universally valid. If we join the limitation of a judgment to the conception of the subject, then the judgment will possess unconditioned validity. For example, the proposition, “All objects are beside each other in space,” is valid only under the limitation that these things are taken as objects of our sensuous intuition. But if I join the condition to the conception, and say, “all things, as external phænomena, are beside each other in space,” then the rule is valid universally, and without any limitation. Our expositions, consequently, teach the reality (i. e. the objective validity) of space in regard of all which can be presented to us externally as object, and at the same time also the ideality of space in regard to objects when they are considered by means of reason as things in themselves, that is, without reference to the constitution of our sensibility. We maintain, therefore, the empirical reality of space in regard to all possible external experience, although we must admit its transcendental ideality; in other words, that it is nothing, so soon as we withdraw the condition upon which the possibility of all experience depends, and look upon space as something that belongs to things in themselves.</p>

<p class='indent'>But, with the exception of space, there is no representation, subjective and referring to something external to us, which could be called objective à priori. For there are no other subjective representations from which we can deduce synthetical propositions à priori, as we can from the intuition of space. (See <a href='https://ericlyonshansen.github.io/Critique of Pure Reason/Transcendental Aesthetic - 3.html'>§ 3</a>.) Therefore, to speak accurately, no ideality whatever belongs to these, although they agree in this respect with the representation of space, that they belong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuous perception; such a mode, for example, as that of sight, of hearing, and of feeling, by means of the sensations of colour, sound, and heat, but which, because they are only sensations, and not intuitions, do not of themselves give us the cognition of any object, least of all, an à priori cognition.</p>

<p class='indent'>My purpose, in the above remark, is merely this: to guard any one against illustrating the asserted ideality of space by examples quite insufficient, for example, by colour, taste, &c.; for these must be contemplated not as properties of things, but only as changes in the subject, changes which may be different in different men. For, in such a case, that which is originally a mere phænomenon, a rose, for example, is taken by the empirical understanding for a thing in itself, though to every different eye, in respect of its colour, it may appear different. On the contrary, the transcendental conception of phænomena in space is a critical admonition, that, in general, nothing which is intuited in space is a thing in itself, and that space is not a form which belongs as a property to things; but that objects are quite unknown to us in themselves, and what we call outward objects, are nothing else but mere representations of our sensibility, whose form is space, but whose real correlate, the thing in itself, is not known by means of these representations, nor ever can be, but respecting which, in experience, no inquiry is ever made.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p class='indent'>Here we can see clearly the Cartesian influence on Kant's transcendental idealism. Descartes had sought to remove the vitality from the natural world, eliminating all substantial forms except for the human soul. But this had created problems: for example, explaining how the immaterial human mind could have any effect on the material world. Kant, counterintuitively perhaps, wants to push Descartes's line of argumentation even farther, rather than retreating. He wants to remove not only the vitality from the natural world, but its extension (and, as we will see in the next section, its duration). Kant had detected that the main thrust of Descartes's metaphysics — abstracting away from the supposed response to skepticism, which is just noise — is a retreat from Aristotelian Christianity to Platonic Christianity. But Descartes's retreat represented a half-measure, for Kant. The full measure is to deprive the external world of full participation in reality, to return it to the dream-world of Plato's "Analogy of the Cave." And, in an amazing sleight of hand, Kant uses precisely the success of the new physics as leverage against the fully reality of the (apparently materialist) external world. How else to explain even the possibility of a Newtonian mechanics, which can predict and capture all physical actions, Kant effectively says, except that we ourselves <i>place</i> Newtonian mechanics into the world?</p>

<p class='indent'>It is also significant that, underlying this argument, there seems to be a certain nihilistic assumption that, in the absence of God and supernatural soul, the external world would be chaotic. I say "nihilistic" because Kant could not imagine a world that was orderly and good <i>in itself</i>. Any order and goodness must be implanted from outside. A purely materialistic world is equivalent to a chaotic and valueless world. Nothing has had a more significant effect on the course of Modern Philosophy than this assumption.</p>

<p class='indent'>(There may also be a certain agonistic tension with Newton here. Kant seeks to deprive Newton of the scale of his achievement by relegating the natural world to an idealistic dream world, where we ourselves "impose" the laws of nature on our dreams.)</p>
